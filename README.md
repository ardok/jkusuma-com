Simple React app with Webpack. Mainly to familiarize myself with setting up a project the technologies mentioned below.

### Dev
* Make sure to use correct node and npm version specified in engines under `package.json`.
* `npm install`

### Technologies used
* Webpack v4
* React
* Styletron (css in js)
* `jest` for testing and `@testing-library/react`.
* `eslint` with `prettier`.

#### Wishlist
* Hopefully could use [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for e2e testing
* Migrate all CSS styling to be inline just to get more familiar with inline styling
